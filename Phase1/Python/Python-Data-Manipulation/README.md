# Python Data Manipulation

Materials:
- [Jupyter Notebook: Python Data Manipulation](python_data_manipulation.ipynb)

## Learning Goals

- Explore basic Python data structure
- Construct list and dictionary comprehensions
- Write functions to transform data
- Extract data from nested data structures

## Lesson Plan

### Intro (5 Mins)

The hook here is more advanced Python for more efficient code.

### Lists and List Comprehension (15 Mins)

This will be new syntax for most students. Exercises are useful here.

### Dictionaries and Dictionary Comprehension (15 Mins)

Ditto.

### Nesting (10 Mins)

The point here is to foreshadow future work that will involve digging through complex structures to isolate data. The key is understanding the different methods of the different data types.

### Functions (10 Mins)

Very powerful. Great for streamlining code.

### Conclusion (5 Mins)

Try to practice with these syntax shapes if they're new to you!
